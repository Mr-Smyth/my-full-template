# Technologies I am Learning

## Learning is for life. . .

This is my very first effort at a Readme.md. I hope to look back on this in the coming weeks, months and years and be in awe of how simplistic and ineffective it is. But for now i am going to do my best to comment on a little project that details the list of Technologies that i am currently learning at Code Institute. I Love Learning, and Learning really is for life...

## WHat does this site do?

This Technologies site lists the technologies and Languages i m currently learning at Code Institute.


## What Technologies were used to build it?

I used HTML5 to layout the structure of the page, with a nav element to contain the site navigation menus, located at the top of the screen.
I then stored each technology within a div card.
I used GitPod as my editor, obviously then pushing up to GitHub.
A Bash Terminal was used, to run various commands and perform Git Interactions.

## What other sources were used?

The images were gained via a google search, and, as this was a practice site, i hot linked to the images for now.
I do howere intend reworking this into a cv site where i will use imgur for my images.
Each of the links also link back to Wikepedia for more information.


## What skills were practiced in this project?

I believe that the HTML and CSS coding was just cementing work done, and as practice is the homework of genious, its time well spent.

## What did i learn?

Gained a good knowledge and level of comfort with Bash Terminal interactions.
Gained more of an understanding of GitHub, and a greater confidence pull and pushing from varios sources.
Gained greater confidence and understanding with HTML and CSS.
